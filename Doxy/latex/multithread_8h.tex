{\footnotesize\ttfamily void multithread (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

This function enables multithread processing. At first the number of iterations is counted, given the number of images to process. Whole processing work is divided by the number of available threads to run. Function starts each thread and as it finished its work, realeases a thread in a for() loop.
